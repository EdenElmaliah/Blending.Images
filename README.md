Blending images using Gaussian & Laplacian pyramids.
To see an example, run "blending_example1()" or "blending_example2()" function. Make sure you have the supplied images from the 'externals' directory. 
If you wish to blend images yourself, run "blending_example(im1_name, im2_name, mask_name)". See the documentation of this function for its inputs type.
